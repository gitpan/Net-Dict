				Net::Dict
				  v1.07

This distribution contains the Net::Dict module for Perl.
Net::Dict is a class implementing a simple client API
for the DICT protocol defined in RFC2229.

To install this module, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test (this can be omitted, as there are no tests currently)
	% make install

The module is documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get a man-page Net::Dict. You can also generate HTML using pod2html:

	% pod2html lib/Net/Dict.pm

Three sample clients are included in this distribution.
Any additional modules required are noted, and available from CPAN.

    dict
	A basic command-line client, based on the C dict client
	by Rik Faith.
	Requires: AppConfig, AppConfig::Std

    tkdict
	A first cut at a Perl/Tk client. This is pretty rough;
	any suggestions or patches are welcome!
	Requires: AppConfig, AppConfig::Std, Tk, Tk::Dialog

    examples/simple.pl
	Illustrates basic use of Net::Dict.

Net::Dict was written by Dmitry Rubinstein, but is now maintained by me.
