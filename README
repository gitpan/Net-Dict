				Net::Dict
				  v1.04

This distribution contains the Net::Dict module for Perl.
Net::Dict is a class implementing a simple client library
for the Dict protocol defined in RFC2229.

To install this module, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test (this can be omitted, as there are no tests currently)
	% make install

The module is documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get a man-page Net::Dict. You can also generate HTML using pod2html:

	% pod2html lib/Net/Dict.pm

In addition to the documentation, the examples directory
contains simple.pl, which illustrates basic use of Net::Dict.

This module was written by Dmitry Rubinstein, but is now
maintained by me.
